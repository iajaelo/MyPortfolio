# MyPortfolio

This portfolio highlights projects that reflect my background in robotics, industrial automation, data engineering, and large-scale system deployments.

My experience centers on end-to-end system design—from hardware & software integration and data ingestion to modeling, orchestration, observability, and deployment at scale. These projects are informed by real operational challenges in robotics and automation environments, with a focus on reliability, scalability, and productivity.

Together, they demonstrate how I design and deliver data-driven systems that bridge data, software, and real-world operations.
